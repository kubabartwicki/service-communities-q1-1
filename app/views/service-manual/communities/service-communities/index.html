      <p>A service community is a network of people from across the public sector who work together to design and deliver an end-to-end service. By end-to-end services, we mean whole user journeys like learning to drive or starting a business.</p>
      
      <p>Communities are made up of people from a variety of professions across the public sector, including policy, delivery and operations. You might want to join or start a community if you’re trying to do things like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>better understand your users</li>
        <li><a href="#">understand the wider context around the thing you’re building</a></li>
        <li><a href="/service-manual/working-across-organisational-boundaries">work across organisational boundaries</a></li>
        <li>shape the design of the wider journey the thing you’re working on is part of </li>
      </ul>
      <p>You will get tried and tested tools and support from the centre of government to collaborate on an end-to-end service. <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2019/01/28/what-service-communities-are-achieving-across-government/">Read more about what service communities are achieving across government</a>.</p>

      <h2 id="join">Join an existing community</h2>
      <p>There are currently 4 active service communities, that deal with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Start a business</li>
        <li>Employ someone</li>
        <li>Import-export</li>
        <li>Get health benefits</li>
      </ul>
      <p><a href="mailto:service-communities@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">Email the team at GDS</a> or join the #servicecommunities <a href="https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com">cross-government Slack channel</a> if you work in any of those areas.</p>


      <h2 id="set-up">Set up a community</h2>
      <p>The communities model is still being tested and you should contact the communities team at GDS before you set up a community so that we can learn more.</p>
      <p>The time it takes to set one up depends on how complex the user journey is and how many organisations need to be involved. For example, the health benefits community had 3 phone calls with the communities team at GDS in September 2018 and ran their first workshop in November 2018. During that period, they wrote a proposal document and invited people to attend a workshop.</p>
      <p>Once your community is up and running, you’ll have to design and lead workshops, keep track of what the community is working on and onboard new people. The communities team at GDS can offer support.</p>

      <p>If you want to set up a service community for your end-to-end service, <a href="mailto:service-communities@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">email us</a> or <a href="/service-manual/working-across-organisational-boundaries">read more about working across organisational boundaries</a>.</p>
      <p>The time it takes to set up a service community will vary depending on how complex your service is and how many departments need to be involved. For example, Get health benefits had 3 phone calls with the team at GDS in September and ran their first workshop in November. In that time, they wrote a proposal document and invited people to attend a workshop. Once your community is up and running, you will have to design and lead workshops, keep track of what the community is working on, and onboard new people.</p>
      
      <p>We will help you make a formal case for collaboration and support you in scoping your service and designing workshops. We also provide guidance on how to collaborate in a sustainable way and case studies showing how others collaborated.</p>

      <h2 id="before-you-start">By setting up a service community, you will be able to:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>contribute to government objectives</li>
        <li>better understand the users of your service</li>
        <li>access people and departments you need to collaborate with</li>
        <li>get support from other departments to understand and improve your service</li>
        <li>have a holistic view of the end to end service that your service is part of</li>
        <li>reduce time and effort to connect with relevant departments</li>
        <li>improve your skills in understanding both the detail of a service and the wider context in which it exists (technical, organisational, societal, political)</li>
        <li>influence key decisions and shape design of services</li>
        <li>increase visibility of the work you are doing</li>
        <li>improve your facilitation and collaboration skills by running community workshops</li>
        <li>use tools to better understand the your users of your end-to-end services</li>
      </ul>

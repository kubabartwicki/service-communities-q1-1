      <p>Service communities are networks of people formed around long or complicated user journeys. These journeys tend to be made up of several elements and transactions and often cut across organisational boundaries.</p>

<p>The communities themselves are made up of people from a variety of professions across the public sector, including policy, digital and operations.</p>

<p>Working in this collaborative way can help you gain a better understanding of the wider context around what you’re working on. Which can help you improve your service and meet <a href="/service-manual/service-standard">the updated Service Standard</a>.</p>

<p>You might want to join or start a community if you’re trying to do things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>better understand your users - for example, some communities have developed personas to help them gain a better understanding of what their users are trying to do</li>
  <li>collaborate across organisational boundaries - for example, by gaining access to the people you need to talk to at regular meetings and workshops</li>
  <li>shape the design of the wider journey your thing is part of</li>
</ul>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2019/01/28/what-service-communities-are-achieving-across-government/">read more about communities and why they’re helpful</a>.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The communities model is still being tested. It’s best to talk the service communities team at GDS before you start or join one.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="join-an-existing-service-community">Join an existing service community</h2>

<p>There are currently 3 active service communities. They deal with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>starting a business</li>
  <li>importing and exporting</li>
  <li>getting health benefits</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re interested in joining one of those communities, you can either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>email the communities team at GDS at <a href="mailto:service-communities@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">service-communities@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk</a>
</li>
  <li>post on the <a rel="external" href="https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/messages/C63GY4WJW/">#servicecommunities cross-government Slack channel</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="start-a-community-yourself">Start a community yourself</h2>

<p>If there isn’t a community in your service area, you could set one up. Setting up a community involves making sure the right people are involved, designing and leading workshops and keeping track of what the community is working on.</p>

<p>The time it takes to set up a community depends on how complex the user journey is and how many organisations need to be involved.</p>

<p>The most recent community (the health benefits community) took roughly 2 months to set up, from the point of first contact with the communities team at GDS to running their first workshop. During that period, they wrote a proposal document and invited people to attend the workshop.</p>

<p>Talk to the communities team at GDS if you want to start a community. You can contact them by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>email, at <a href="mailto:service-communities@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">service-communities@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk</a>
</li>
  <li>posting in the <a rel="external" href="https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/messages/C63GY4WJW/">#servicecommunities cross-government Slack channel</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s also <a href="/service-manual/design/working-across-organisational-boundaries">guidance to help you set up and run your community</a> if you decide you want to start one.</p>

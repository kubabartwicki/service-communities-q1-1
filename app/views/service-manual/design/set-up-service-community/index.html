      <h2 id="check-if-service-community-is-right-for-you">1. Check if a service community is right for you</h2>
      <p>If you are trying to improve the wider context of a service you work on or are struggling to collaborate across organisational boundaries, you might want to set up a service community for your area. It can help you reduce duplication in a service, learn what other teams are doing and join up a whole user journey using things like step-by-step on GOV.UK.</p>
      <p>A service community is a network of people who work on the same service in the public sector. It is formed to improve a service by bringing together people who work on them, no matter what organisation they work for. A community works uses meetings and digital channels, like mailing lists, to work together.</p>
      <p>Setting one up involves making sure the right people are involved, designing and leading workshops and keeping track of what the community is working on.</p>
      <p><a href="../service-communities">Learn more about service communities</a></p>

      <h2 id="list-problems-you-are-trying-to-solve">2. List the problems you are trying to solve</h2>
      <p>Setting up a service community can help you address problems in your service by working with other teams who are affected by them.</p>
      <p>For example, the import-export service community exists to share knowledge in the space, as lots of teams work on similar things. Others, like the start a business service community, is improving guidance by publishing step-by-step guides on GOV.UK so that the service works better for users.</p>
      <p>You should start by listing the problems that affect your service and impact others in the public sector. You will use these to bring people together and they might become the first draft of your community objectives. </p>

      <h2 id="identify-who-can-help-solve-those-problems">3. Identify who can help you solve those problems</h2>
      <p>It’s best to start your service community by talking to those in the public sector that you already know. This is because it’s easier to work with small teams and others can help you grow the community later on.</p>
      <p>Do this by listing the organisations and teams that are affected by the problems you want to solve. These teams might be within your own organisation. Once you’ve done this, think about the people within those teams that you know. Your community can include people who work in policy, operations and delivery and at all levels of seniority.</p>
      <p>If you don’t know anyone within those teams, you can use cross-government Slack or communities of practice to find them. We <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kqX3sfFbqSlGTyp0k484yCBbDJL5OlTdn7oAn9JJ_dg/edit">have a template</a> that might make it easier for you.</p>

      <h2 id="get-in-touch-and-propose-service-community">4. Get in touch with them and propose a service community</h2>
      <p>Contact those that you know in your area by explaining what problems you want to address and how setting up a service community will help you address them. Suggest a call or a meeting to make a decision on objectives and ways of working. We <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aulypuVodRgUy3ihRJgZ-oUFB7-fYjmZyWYoUloEqF0/edit">have a template</a> that others used to suggest this.</p>
      <p>Some communities, like import-export, formalised this using a proposal document. It’s a statement that explains what the community will do together and why. It makes it easier for people to understand what you’re asking of them - and for them to explain to their senior stakeholders why joining the community would be a good use of their time. The <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5cc1b875e5274a467d84f296/Import-Export_community_proposal_document.odt">import-export proposal document</a> outlined the need to reduce duplication across the import-export space and which departments they felt needed to be involved.</p>

      <h2 id="agree-together-on-what-you-are-trying-to-achieve">5. Agree together on what you’re trying to achieve and how you will achieve it</h2>
      <p>The first thing you should do when talking to prospective community members is to agree on what problems you are trying to solve together. This will impact how the community works together. Most communities host meetings every one or two months and use a mailing list to communicate in-between meetings. Others have regular calls, use Slack to chat or organise using Trello.</p>
      <p>Meetings help you get to know each other can help you build a sense of community. Being able to talk to each other between meetings is crucial. It will help you strengthen relationships, get feedback or input on your work and make sure everyone maintains the same understanding of what you’re doing.</p>
      <p>Communication issues are a common blocker to cross-departmental working so don’t worry if it’s not possible to get everyone using your preferred tool. The most important thing is to share things regularly - even if you have to email documents to one another. And where possible, work in the open and publish things on the internet. Anyone can access a blog post.</p>
      <p>You can summarise your objectives and ways of working in a document that is sometimes called a ‘terms of reference’ document.</p>

      <h2 id="plan-activity">6. Plan an activity</h2>

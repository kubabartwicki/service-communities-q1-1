      <p>You’ll sometimes need to work with other teams from inside and outside of your department, especially <a href="/link-to-problem-space-mapping-guidance">if the thing you’re working on is part of a wider journey</a> that cuts across organisational boundaries. </p>

      <p>Working together is difficult. It requires you to balance different priorities, ways of working and funding cycles - and it adds an extra layer of bureaucracy.</p>

      <p>It’ll also usually involve working remotely from different locations. 18F (the US government’s digital agency) offers <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/10/15/best-practices-for-distributed-teams/">tips on effective remote working</a>. </p>

      <h2>A way of addressing common collaboration challenges</h2>

      <p>A few teams across government have had success working in groups called ‘service communities’. These are networks of people with different skills that work across organisations to deliver services that work well for users.</p>

      <p>They tend to form around big or challenging user journeys - like starting a business - to make sure they’re scoped and built in a user-centred way. </p>

      <p>Some of the working practices they use have helped them address some of the more common collaboration challenges. </p>

      <p>You can <a href="/link-to-community-page">check if there’s already a service community in your area</a> to join. But even if there isn’t, you could still use the artefacts and ways of working they use to:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>start a service community of your own</li>
      <li>work across organisations in a less formal way</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you want to learn more, or are interested in starting a community, it’s worth emailing the communities team at GDS at <link to email address>. </p>

      <h2>How to run a cross-government service community</h2>

      <p>For your community to be successful, you’ll need to make sure you’re involving the right people and that it has a clear purpose. </p>

      <h3>Persuade the right people to get involved</h3>

      <p>As well as including all the relevant departments, you need to make sure your community is made up of people from across the policy, operations and digital professions. </p>

      <p>And include a mix of:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>people at delivery level, who understand the detail of the various elements of the service you’re working on</li>
      <li>senior people who can influence the strategic direction of the service</li>
      </ul>

      <p>To make it easier to persuade people to join, put together a statement that explains what you’re planning to do and why. That’ll make it easier for people to understand what you’re asking of them - and for them to explain to their senior stakeholders why it’s a good use of their time. </p>

      <p>DIT found this useful when they were trying to build support for their import-export service community. Their proposal document outlined the need to reduce duplication across the import-export space and which departments they felt needed to be involved. </p>

      <p>You can <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nAIaQikbojJf0CG2uzOopGae6E3YiaBiVdXoxdLArkE/edit">read the import-export proposal document</a> to find out more. </p>

      <h3>Agree on what you’re trying to achieve</h3>

      <p>Even once you’ve put together the right team, it can be difficult to keep everyone focused on a common aim. This is completely understandable, given that people from different departments are accountable to different stakeholders. </p>

      <p>One way of keeping everyone on track is to agree and document things like:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>common objectives</li>
      <li>when meetings will take place and how often</li>
      <li>who’s in charge of facilitating meetings</li>
      <li>the roles and responsibilities of everyone in the community</li>
      <li>who your senior sponsors are</li>
      <li>how you’ll share information and resources</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The document you put together is sometimes called a ‘terms of reference’ document. </p>

      <p>The start a business service community found this approach very helpful. You can read their <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IEWt7s5f9Homj1txcLuq12fTvkwphitbFB0glyacZMo/edit">terms of reference document</a>.</p>

      <h3>Set up communication channels</h3>

      <p>Communication issues are a common blocker to cross-departmental working. </p>

      <p>It’s crucial you can talk to each other between meetings - this helps you strengthen relationships, get feedback or input on your work and makes sure everyone maintains the same understanding of what you’re doing. </p>

      <p>Setting up digital channels is usually the best way of making this happen. For example, you coud: </p>

      <ul>
      <li>set up a Google group, which acts as an online forum and email list</li>
      <li>create a Slack channel for everyone to use</li>
      <li>have a shared online calendar</li>
      <li>arrange regular stand ups that everyone can dial into</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Sharing things like documents and calendars can be tricky, as departments tend to use a range of different admin systems. </p>

      <p>HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>) and the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) faced this challenge when they <a href="https://dwpdigital.blog.gov.uk/2016/11/01/one-million-up-what-weve-learned-from-building-check-your-state-pension/">worked together on the Check your State Pension service</a>. </p>

      <p>The <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> members of the team initially couldn't access <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>'s project management tools. The team got access for their <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> colleagues by providing <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> email addresses for them to use during the project. </p>

      <p>Don’t worry if it’s not possible to get everyone using your preferred tool, though. The most important thing is to share things regularly - even if you have to just email documents to one another.</p>

      <p>And where possible, work in the open and publish things on the internet. Anyone can access a blog post. </p>

      <h3>Agree a common language</h3>

      <p>Agreeing a common language can also prove useful. The start a business community found this helped them keep everyone on the same page.</p>

      <p>You can see their <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X6criv5L5ilSLoiJTuqg_9JTO7USRRctfPDfLRrs6aw/edit?usp=drive_open&amp;ouid=117355483021400811652">common terms document</a>, which allowed them to agree on the meaning of important words like ‘company’, ‘sole trader’ and ‘validation’. Having different interpretations of these words could have made it more difficult for them to progress their work. </p>

      <h3>Share research insights and data where possible</h3>

      <p>Collaborating on research and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/sharing-user-research-findings">sharing research findings</a> is useful for several reasons. Firstly, it’s cheaper, because you don’t have to run separate rounds of research. </p>

      <p>It also spreads knowledge and gives community members access to insights they wouldn’t otherwise have. </p>

      <p>So invite as many people to attend research sessions as you can. </p>

      <p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> did this when they worked on Check your State Pension. It allowed them to introduce their policy and legal colleagues to user-centred design principles and made it much easier to set up pairing sessions with content designers. </p>

      <p>It’s also much easier to solve disagreements if everyone has access to the evidence. </p>

      <h3>Create a common backlog</h3>

      <p>Some of the existing service communities have had success working from a common backlog. </p>

      <p>For instance, the start a business community uses a Trello board to help them keep track of the work they’re doing. </p>

      <p>Before putting together the Trello board, the team established individual and departmental priorities. Doing this exercise together made it easier to keep the end user and their overall goal in mind when planning these activities.</p>

      <p>One thing you could do to generate ideas for the backlog is to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-qrlR4VGCFp9v5jI0OGEP60wERJ_fzmM5UCzktojR70/edit">map the user journey you’re working on</a>.</p>

      <p>This will help you spot issues stopping the user journey from joining up as well as it could have - for example duplication or lack of join-up across transactions. These changes could form the start of your common backlog. </p>
